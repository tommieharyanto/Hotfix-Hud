Hotfix Hud v8.2 RC by E-Mxp.
For Unvanquished Alpha 11.

Initially intended as a hotfix, I have added some more things to help make an awesome hud just a tad more awesome.
The best part of Superpie's Tweaked GPP HUD was (in my opinion) the centered hud, however, I found out that the centered hud was made to be perfectly aligned if you have a 4:3 resolution (as you can see if you look at the human inventory arrow and more noticeably, in the alien hud).
While working on the fix I learned more about how the code works and I decided to add more options.


MAIN FEATURES:

* Integrated into the options.
* 5 hud layouts! Default, Centered, Compact, the new Hotbar hud and the new Cross Hud!
* Custom loadingscreen.
* For all the layouts (exept Hotbar) you have a choice of 3 color schemes:
	- The Superpie hud color scheme. (Default)
	- The Warrior hud color scheme. Based off the Warrior's Hud by Warrior.
	- The Hellrider hud color scheme. Based off the Hellrider Hud (v1.1) by Hellrider.
* The option to place the Adv. Good barbs underneath the crosshair.
* Optional fullscreen radar.
* Optional stamina progress bar!
* Optional Human crosshair dot in 4 colors: white, blue, red and black.
* Option menu to change the appearance of the console.
* Mostly Unvanquished compatible!
	
NOTES:
All "hud_" (exept "hud_style") commands get applied immediately, so there is no need to restart.
Also, if you remember the hud directories, you can change the hud without reloading by entering /reloadhud in the console!

Special thanks to:
Superpie, for creating the Tweaked GPP HUD I know and love.
Warrior, for crafting the Warrior's Hud, a hud thats very colorfull and nice.
Hellrider, for spawning the Hellrider Hud, a hud that looks quite cool and not black and white yet.
Meisseli, for making up a very easy way to fix the inventory aspect ratio problem. Try his HUD out!
Mox, for giving me the idea to add pictures to the main menu. His AdjustableHUD is really good, try it!
Oticz, for his dot crosshair code. If you still play 1.1, his HUD is highly recommended!
GeneralScott, for giving me full permission to use his staminabar code, awesome!
Kang's hud, who had the most awesome loadingscreen I have seen in Tremulous!

A great help was this site on Icculus.org (http://icculus.org/~phaethon/q3tamenu/q3tamenu.html) and is recommanded to everyone trying to make huds for Tremulous!
